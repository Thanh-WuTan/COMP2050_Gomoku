# Gomoku
## Project Introduction

In this project, I implemented various AI algorithms for Gomoku, an extension of Tic Tac Toe. I have also completed a previous project on Tic Tac Toe, which can be found here: [COMP2050_TicTacToe](https://github.com/Thanh-WuTan/COMP2050_TicTacToe). The focus is on improving the strategic decision-making of AI in Gomoku.
